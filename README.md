# Test task from 100HP Games
 This is an accomplished test task from 100hp games


## The task:
 - develop a working prototype of the game on Unity, focusing on the basic mechanics of the game "Tower - inactive tower defense", as a reference.

 Essential mechanics: 
 - The presence of a base object on which enemies are approaching;
 - The presence of enemy objects that are approaching the base;
 - The presence of defensive mechanics: the base shoots > projectile flies at the enemy > enemy dies;
 - The presence of defeat mechanics: the enemy reached the base > end of the game session;
 - The presence of 3 types of upgrades for defensive weapons:
    - inflicted damage (the enemy is killed with 3 - 2 - 1 shot);
    - rate of fire;
    - range;
 - Each upgrade type can be upgraded 2-3 times;
 - Any freely available sprites and animations can be used as game graphics.
